These structured sections align with the typical setup for managing intents and responses within a Rasa project.

responses:

    - text: "The Lucky Wheel is your ticket to spinning a wheel of fortune and grabbing some epic rewards, like bubbles, gold, and even free spins in Highrise."

  utter_lucky_wheel_spinning_frequency:
    - text: "You can spin the magical Lucky Wheel once a day. Plus, if you watch a quick ad, you get an extra spin on the same day!"

  utter_lucky_wheel_multiple_accounts:

    - text: "The Lucky Wheel timer resets at noon UTC for everyone, no matter the time zone!"

  utter_finding_lucky_wheel:

    - text: "In Highrise, 'Grabs' are sets of items that you can win by spinning in the game. They appear in the Shop several times a week, offering unique items to enhance your gameplay."

  utter_ask_how_to_find_grabs:
    - text: "You can find Grabs by tapping the Shop icon in your bottom menu. Under 'Featured Grabs', you'll discover all available sets to spin for exciting rewards."

  utter_ask_about_event_room:
    - text: "During live events, new Grabs can be found in the Event Room. Tap the event icon in the lower right of your home room screen, go to the event menu's top, and click 'Go to Event Room' to discover these special Grabs."

  utter_ask_about_rarities:
    - text: "Grabs contain items classified under different Rarities such as Uncommon, Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Most grab bags contain Rare items, while the rarest are the Epics and the ultimate Legendaries."

  utter_ask_about_legendary_items:
    - text: "Legendary items are special prizes in Grabs and can be won by acquiring all items in a grab. They can be re-won after a grab is reset. Limited-Time Legendaries are fleeting, so act quickly to secure them!"
```

These sections are ready for use in their respective Rasa YAML files for intents and responses.

responses:
  utter_ask_item_rarity_value:
    - text: |
        Every item in Highrise has its own unique value. Some items are rarer and hold more value in the marketplace due to their limited availability.

  utter_inquire_item_rarity_categories:
    - text: |
        Items in Highrise fall into four categories: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. These categories indicate their rarity and value, with Legendary being the most scarce and precious.

  utter_ask_spin_chances:
    - text: |
        When you spin for gold grabs in Highrise, you can get either a rare or an epic item. Rare items appear more frequently, and once you collect all items, a Legendary item is rewarded.

  utter_inquire_grab_types:
    - text: |
        Gold grabs often expire sooner and are linked with rarer items, whereas bubble grabs are more likely to produce common items, eventually leading to an Epic item upon collecting all items.

  utter_ask_item_availability_and_trade:
    - text: |
        Some items might not be available in the shop because gold grabs expire faster. These items can often be purchased from other players in the trade section or acquired with gold.
```

These YAML sections are structured for compatibility with Rasa's format for defining intents and responses separately.

responses:
  utter_inquire_shopping_experience:
    - text: "You're right, shopping in Highrise is a delight! You can choose from the latest fashions to luxurious furniture without leaving your virtual home."

    - text: "Once inside, explore the shop's many sections including Clothing, Interior, Face&Body, Grabs, and Cash. It�s a fun journey at the top of your screen."

  utter_understand_trade_options:
    - text: "You can trade using bubbles or gold, whichever you prefer, for a versatile shopping experience."
```

responses:
  utter_enter_design_mode:

  utter_find_grab_item:
    - text: "If you can't find a particular piece of furniture, it might be an old grab item. Check the Marketplace as some players may have it for sale."
```

responses:
  utter_ask_about_grab_expiry:
    - text: "Yes, indeed! Gold grabs bid you adieu after approximately a month, while bubble grabs stick around a bit longer."

  utter_grab_expiry_difference:
    - text: "Gold grabs last for about a month, while bubble grabs have a longer duration. That�s just the nature of grab life."

  utter_missed_grab_options:
    - text: "Missed a grab? No need for panic! You can explore Storefronts or Second-hand Grabs to find items from expired grabs. Check tags like #sfexplore, #selling, #buying, #trading for a vibrant trading scene."
```

responses:
  utter_check_grab_info:
    - text: "On a Grab screen, click the little info icon underneath the Grab's name. This will bring up the Spin Rates for that grab and any Swap Rates (if that grab has swapping enabled)."

  utter_spin_rates_variability:
    - text: "No, Spin Rates are not the same for all Grabs and change very often. We recommend checking the Spin Rates before you begin spinning any Grab."

  utter_grab_rigging_misconception:
    - text: "While it might be some bad luck, it's most definitely not rigged. The common misconception here is not realizing each spin is an independent variable."

  utter_grab_probability_explanation:
    - text: "Imagine our game's spins like reaching into a bag of 100 marbles, where 10 are red (winning marbles) and 90 are blue. Each spin is like pulling out a marble, checking its color, and then putting it back. No matter how many times you reach in, your chance of pulling out a red marble is always 10%. Just like pulling marbles from the bag, each game spin is an independent event. This means that spinning 100 times doesn't guarantee you'll pull out 10 red marbles. It's completely possible to have a streak of blue ones because every spin is a fresh chance, not affected by the previous or future spins."
```

responses:
  utter_introduce_second_hand_grabs:
    - text: "Second-hand grabs are like your personal vending machines for grabs! Place them in your room, stuff them with your items, and let other players try their luck. The best part? You keep 70% of all the gold your machine rakes in."

  utter_setup_second_hand_grabs:
    - text: "Think of it as your own mini lottery. You can add or remove items whenever you want and set the draw price anywhere from 1 to 99,999 gold. You also get to set the odds for different rarity levels (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary)."

  utter_manage_second_hand_grabs:
    - text: "Here's the scoop: when all items of a specific rarity are drawn, that rarity's odds get added to the lowest remaining one. So, if your Rare items run out, their odds get passed on to the Common ones. You can see who drew from your grab, what they got, and how much gold they spent, all through the handy history button on the Second-hand Grab interface."

  utter_visitor_interactions:
    - text: "Visitors can view your username, check out the odds, draw from the grab, and keep track of updates and wins. They'll also get notified if you disable the grab or if all items are drawn. It's as transparent as a freshly cleaned window!"
```

responses:
  utter_explain_progress_rewards:
    - text: "Progress Rewards are delightful bonuses you receive as you spin grabs and collect new items. They provide a boost on your journey to obtaining that coveted Legendary item."
  
  utter_progress_rewards_earning:
    - text: "You earn Progress Rewards by spinning and collecting unique items from a grab. Remember, only Rare and Epic items count towards your Progress Meter, and duplicates don't add any progress."

  utter_progress_reward_meters:
    - text: "The Progress Reward Meter is an additional meter beneath the standard Completion Reward Meter. It keeps track of your unique items collected and indicates how many more you need to earn the Progress Reward."

  utter_claiming_progress_rewards:
    - text: "Once your Progress Meter is full, the Progress Reward is automatically claimed. A special animation will appear when you spin that final item, and you'll find your reward in your closet inventory."

  utter_progress_rewards_variability:
    - text: "Indeed, different grabs require different numbers of items to complete. Hence, the item count needed to unlock Progress Rewards can vary between grabs."

  utter_post_legendary_rewards_reset:
    - text: "After you claim the Legendary item and finish the grab, all progress resets. Both the Progress and Completion Meters return to zero, allowing you to start again and unlock all rewards anew."
```

These sections can be saved into respective YAML files: one for the NLU data and another for the response data, ensuring compatibility with Rasa's training model.

responses:
  utter_inquire_grab_tokens:
    - text: "Grab Tokens are your fun pass to the world of Grabs! You've got two kinds of tokens: the gold Grab Token and the silver Promo Token."

  utter_usage_of_grab_tokens:
    - text: "Use the gold Grab Tokens to spin, and the items you win can be traded freely. The items you spin with the silver Promo Tokens are bound to your account, meaning no trading or transferring."

  utter_run_out_of_tokens:
    - text: "Don't worry if your Grab Token stash hits zero. You can keep the good times rolling by using some gold for your spins. Easy-peasy!"

  utter_special_grab_rules:
    - text: "Heads up! Some grabs only accept gold or bubbles, and do not allow Grab Tokens. These grabs march to the beat of their own drum!"
```

Each section contains all necessary intents and responses formatted according to Rasa's standards. You can use these configurations in separate YAML files under the `nlu` and `responses` directories within your Rasa project.

responses:

  utter_importance_of_detailed_reports:

  utter_appeal_final_decision:
    - text: |
        All appeal decisions are final and at the discretion of our Trust and Safety team.
```

These two sections should be placed in separate YAML files to properly integrate with Rasa. The `nlu` section should go into one file dedicated to defining intents, and the `responses` section should be in a file used for defining the responses.

This structure will help in configuring your Rasa model for handling user queries related to kicking or banning players from rooms.
