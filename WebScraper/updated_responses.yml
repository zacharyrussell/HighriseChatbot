  utter_gold_bar_inflation_protection:

  utter_grab_probability_explanation:
  - text: Imagine our game's spins like reaching into a bag of 100 marbles, where
      10 are red (winning marbles) and 90 are blue. Each spin is like pulling out
      a marble, checking its color, and then putting it back. No matter how many times
      you reach in, your chance of pulling out a red marble is always 10%. Just like
      pulling marbles from the bag, each game spin is an independent event. This means
      that spinning 100 times doesn't guarantee you'll pull out 10 red marbles. It's
      completely possible to have a streak of blue ones because every spin is a fresh
      chance, not affected by the previous or future spins.

      misconception here is not realizing each spin is an independent variable.
